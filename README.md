A memory game which was built to play in leisure time, it also helped me clear up the fundamentals of my JavaScript. It is a game in which there are four primary colored boxes and the boxes are going to blink in any random order and the player has to tap the complete sequence with the add-ons to upgrade to the next level. Do try this and let me know your high score
